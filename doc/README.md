# PocketAlchemy Documentation

---

This folder contains all the documentation for PocketAlchemy. Both the source .tex files and rendered pdfs are included.

Each version of pocket alchemy has a single folder named after the version, e.g. /v1.0.alpha for version code "1.0.alpha". This folder contains all relevant documentation for that given version including product overviews and source code documentation.
