\indent Version 0.1.alpha is the second named version of PocketAlchemy.
It represents a significant leap from 0.0.alpha. The addition of Firebase means 
0.1.alpha includes authentication for users via anonymous logins. In addition,
Firebase Firestore is used as a solution for data persistence.
Hilt is used for dependency injection. In addition to the planned features
for 0.2.alpha, development will focus on general UI polish.
